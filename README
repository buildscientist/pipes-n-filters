Requirements: 
Python 2.7 or higher. 

How-To: 
To run the processor execute the python interpreter against it e.g. 

python processor.py --data-source /path/to/data/source

Note: The resources directory already contains the text files being processed again. The stopwords.txt file must stay in there as I have hardcoded that path in the code.
